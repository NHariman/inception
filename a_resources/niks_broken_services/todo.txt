goal of the project:
set up a kubernetes multi-service cluster with each service running a dedicated container.

services:
- grafana (3000)
- wordpress (5050)
- nginx (80/443/22)
- phpmyadmin (5000)
- FTPS (21)
- influxdb (8088)
- mysql (3306)

components:
- kubernetes web dashboard
- load balancer (metallb)
- wordpress website on port 5050 with mysql database and nginx server
- phpmyadmin on port 5000 with sql database and nginx server.
- nginx server on ports 80 and 443. [DONE]
	- port 80 needs a 301 redirection to 443 [DONE]
	- if /wordpress is routed, 307 redirect to IP:WPPORT [DONE]
	- if /phpmyadmin is routed, reverse proxy to IP:PMAPORT [DONE]
- FTPS server on port 21
- grafana platform on port 3000
	- must link to Influx DB database
	- must monitor all containers
	- requires one dashboard per service
	- InfluxDB and grafana must be in two distinct containers

behaviours:
- data presistence in case of a db crash
- access to nginx by logging into ssh
- containers must resstart in case of crash or stop of components.
- redirection must be done with Load Balancer.
	- LoadBalancer for: FTPS, Grafana, Wordpress, PhpMyAdmin, nginx
	- ClusterIP for: influxDB, MySQL.
	- THE USE OF NODEPORT IS FORBIDDEN.

about ports: 
for mySQL, port 3306 https://www.speedguide.net/port.php?port=3306
for influxdb, port 8086 for client-server communication and 8088 for backup and restore operations. https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1.7/introduction/installation/
