# location of the nginx config file depends on how the software is installed
# /etc/nginx/nginx.config
# if not there it could be at
# /usr/local/nginx/conf/nginx.conf
# or
# /usr/local/etc/nginx/nginx.conf

# the config has a tree like structure defined by sets of brackets {}
# the areas that these brackets define are called contexts, they contain
# configuration details that are separted according to their area of concern

# context can be layered with other contexts, nginx prvides a level of
# directive inheritance. If a directive is valid in multiple nested scopes,
# a declaration in a broader context will be passed to any child contexts
# as default values. 
# directives can only be used in the contexts they were designed for.

# THE CORE CONTEXT
# The context that nginx utilizes in order to create a hierarchical tree
# and seperate the concerns of discrete config blocks, the major structure
# of an nginx config.

# THE MAIN CONTEXT: the only context that is not contained in the context block

# The main context is here
....
context {
    ....
}

# Any directive outside the bloack is said to inhabit the main context.
# The main context represents the broadest environment for nginx config. It is
# used to configure details that affect the entire application on basic level.
